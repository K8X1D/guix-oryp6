** Context of the project
This guix configuration aims the gives basis set-up for a System76 Oryx Pro laptop.  

 It is configurated for my own use, but some of the configuration (reverse prime, nvidia dynamic powermanagement, wifi support) could be reused.  

 It sadly had to rely on some of non-free software support for hardware consideration. For support for non-free software on guix (for laptop that heavily really on thoses), see [[https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix][nonguix channel]].

*** Machine description:
